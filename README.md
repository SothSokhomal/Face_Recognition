# Face_Recognition
An end-to-end facial recognition pipeline built with Python and OpenCV. The application leverages real-time webcam integration to detect faces, draw bounding boxes, and perform accurate identity verification by labeling individuals with their corresponding names.

## Overview
This project implements a live facial recognition system using Python and OpenCV. 

## Key Features
* **Real-Time Processing:** Captures and processes live video feeds directly from your webcam.
* **Face Detection:** Accurately locates faces within the video frame and highlights them with bounding boxes.
* **Identity Recognition:** Goes beyond simple detection by analyzing facial features to accurately identify and label known individuals by name.
